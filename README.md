# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

# API end-points

1. #GET /v1/pages

2. #POST /v1/pages
params : page[url] # Example: page[url] = "www.google.com"

For better API view, we can also integrate Swagger Docs/UI.
